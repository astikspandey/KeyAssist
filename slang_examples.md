## What KeyAssist Will Do:

All of these will be transformed into proper, professional English:
- Expand ALL abbreviations (idk → I don't know)
- Convert slang to proper words (bussin → amazing, slaps → excellent)
- Fix grammar and spelling
- Make it professional while keeping the original meaning
- Remove informal tone markers (fr fr, no cap, etc.)

Try it out! Copy any example above, paste it somewhere, select it, and press **Control+Option+X**!
